# Stair climbing logs

You can check a log file from HRP-4 climbing stairs during the industrial demonstrators by running the following command from this directory:

```sh
python ./display_logs.py
```

Check out the pre-defined plots from the "User plots" menu. The ones we use the most are ``Tracking DCM-ZMP X/Y``, ``Foot force both`` and ``Swing foot Z``.
