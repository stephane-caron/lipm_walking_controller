/** Exponential Moving Average.
 *
 * This filter can be seen as an integrator:
 *
 *    y(t) = 1/T int_{u=0}^t x(u) e^{(u - t) / T} d{u}
 *
 * with T > 0 a reset period acting as anti-windup. It can also (informally) be
 * interpreted as the average value of the input signal x(t) over the last T
 * seconds. Formally, it represents the amount of time for the smoothed
 * response of a unit input to reach 1-1/e (~63%) of the original signal.
 *
 * See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing>. It is equivalent
 * to a low-pass filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter> applied
 * to the integral of the input signal.
